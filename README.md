 - Clean up dates:  
    - Utilize Case ID to create a new Date column and reformat. All dates prior to 1975 was dropped along with rows with dates that could not be determined. 
 - Initital cleanup of Activities: 
    - Began to group similar activities together such as "Surfing." More detail cleaning saved for later.    
 - Export to new csv file to use for analysis 
 
## Analysis:
    ### Location Analysis:
        - Does season of the year affect the likelyhood of being attacked by a shark? 
        - What location has the most shark attacks? 
        
    ### Victim Analysis: 
        - What is the percentage of male vs female? 
        - What is the fatality percentage? 
        - Are certain activities more indicative of a shark attack?

        - What shark type attacks the most? 
        - What shark types have the most fatality? 

          
STRETCH: prevelance by weather (API)
STRETCH API Data (2 questions):    
        - Obtian historic weather for location on date (group by month or week?)
             - Compare with number of attacks   
             - Some sort of chart 
             - Hypotheosis: Storm increases shart attacks due to musky weather 
Shark mating season (another data set?)
             - Compile with location - hypotheosis: mating season increases shark attacks
