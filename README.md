Clean up data
 - clean up dates
    - clean up case id and format as Date
        - Drop bad Case ID (i.e. ones with "ND" to start)
        - Drop before 1975
    - post 1975
    - attempt to get a good date
        - Remove "Reported"
    - drop things without good dates
 - clean up activities
        - Grouping similar activities together   
 - isolate to location
 - export to new csv file to use for analysis 
 
Analysis:
 - 6-8 questions we want to anwer:
    - ANDY: Location Analysis (2 questions):
        - season
            - Bar Graph?  
        - country (Country > Area > Location)
            - Map
    - STACEY:Victim Analysis (2 questions):
        - m/f
             - Pie Chart? 
        - by activity
             - Bar Graph? 
             - Incorporate location for scatter plot   
    - JAKE: Shark Analysis (2 questions):
        - by shark type
             - Bar or Pie 
        - fatal v. non-fatal (compare to shark)
             - Pie with unknown
             - Compare activity with fatality 
        - shark mating season (another data set?)
             - Compile with location - hypotheosis: mating season increases shark attacks 
    - STRETCH API Data (2 questions):    
        - Obtian historic weather for location on date (group by month or week?)
             - Compare with number of attacks   
             - Some sort of chart 
             - Hypotheosis: Storm increases shart attacks due to musky weather 
          
 - STRETCH: prevelance by weather (API)
